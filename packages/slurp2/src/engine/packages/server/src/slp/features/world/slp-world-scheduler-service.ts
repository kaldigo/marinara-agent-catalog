 * player is here (the badge poll marks it) it runs every tick length, so the world moves while they
 * watch, not only when the Inbox opens (user, fix phase 1b / R1-106).
 *
 * The tick itself is free-tier. The model work after it (bank top-up, pending rewrites, written
 * replies, continuity) follows the AI budget: with the player here it runs as present work, away
 * only in background mode, and every job claims a paced share of the day's calls. All of it is
 * best-effort and kept off this poll's backoff clock: the free tick must not slow down because
 * model work could not run.
