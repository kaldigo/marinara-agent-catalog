/**
 * What happens in an ordinary post: a beat, chosen before the post is written.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules. See `docs/WORLD-SIMULATION.md`.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * The planner decided why a post is made and how it goes out, never what happened. The model
 * filled the gap with the same few subjects (laundry, moving, coffee, mirror selfies), every
 * Creator converged on them, and Creators stopped using their own canon. A probe showed that a
 * concrete beat grounded in the card gives far more specific posts, and that a single complication
 * deck makes a new shared formula ("small flaw, keep it or fix it").
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * A beat type from a taxonomy (a mishap is one type among twelve), weighted by the Creator's own
 * palette and by what this Creator and the whole feed used lately, is combined with one canon
 * anchor from the card and one written situation template. The intent is derived from the beat,
 * so a post labelled `set` no longer opens as a coffee update.
