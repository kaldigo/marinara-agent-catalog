/**
 * Slurp's action layer: the named things a helper can do for the player ("improve text", "draw a

 * `mari-actions:slurp2` service on Engines with Capability API 1.50).
 *
 * Every action has a name, a one-line summary in plain words, a description of each input, and a zod
 * schema. The server validates every call against the schema here before it runs; the client uses the
 * same schema and types, so both sides agree on one contract. See docs/architecture/README.md
