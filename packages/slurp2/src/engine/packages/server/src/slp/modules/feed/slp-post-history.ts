 * What this page and the rest of the feed already posted about, as subjects rather than text.
 *
 * Eight full captions went into every prompt, and the model learned its own verbal habits from
 * them: on a production install one Creator used the same filler word in 18 of 24 posts, and it
 * appeared nowhere in the card, only ten times in this section. So only the last post is quoted,
 * for continuity; older posts appear as their title and what they showed, which is enough to avoid
 * a repeat and carries no voice to copy. Other Creators' recent public titles are listed so the
 * whole feed stops posting about the same thing on the same day.
 *
 * In classic mode the last caption is the only carrier of post-to-post facts ("more tomorrow"). In
 * beats mode a published post's beat becomes a continuity fact, so no caption is quoted at all.
