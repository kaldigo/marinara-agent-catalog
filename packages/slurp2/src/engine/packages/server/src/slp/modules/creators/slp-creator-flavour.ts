/**
 * The flavour brief: who this Creator is and how they sound, compiled by code before a post,
 * Story, DM, comment reply or hand-over note goes to the model.
 *
 * Pure. The callers read the card, the anchors, their own past lines and the player's steering;
 * this decides what the model hears.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Every request carried the same labelled card dump ("Description: … Personality: …"), so the
 * model grabbed the same few traits every time, never saw how the person actually talks (the
 * card's example dialogue was never read), and nothing told a Creator they had opened five posts
 * in a row with the same two words. Different Creators converged; one Creator repeated itself.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * A short core (who they are) plus a varied handful of true details from the card, the canon
 * anchors and their own past lines, drawn per request. Consecutive requests never share a detail:
 * every detail belongs to one of two alternating halves. One real line of theirs shows the voice.
 * A phrase they overuse is allowed now and then and called out the rest of the time. The player's
 * steering (focus, life phase, mood, topics) is always there, in plain words. No labels, no JSON.
