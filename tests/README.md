# Capability integration tests

`spatial-context.e2e.ts` is the Hierarchical Maps package's browser integration suite. It was moved with the feature so the lightweight Engine smoke suite does not require optional routes or UI to exist.

Run it against a Marinara Engine checkout that has the local Hierarchical Maps package installed and active, using the Engine Playwright configuration:

```bash
cd ../Marinara-Engine
pnpm exec playwright test ../Marinara-Agents/tests/spatial-context.e2e.ts -c playwright.config.ts
```

The package must be installed in the test data directory before launching the Playwright web server.

The Long-Term Memory regressions cover storage, extraction, runtime recall,
privileged routes, debug logging, and the exact release artifact lifecycle:

```bash
cd ../Marinara-Engine
 set -e
 for test in storage extraction-graph runtime routes debug-log lifecycle; do
  MARINARA_ENGINE_ROOT="$PWD" pnpm --filter @marinara-engine/server exec tsx \
    "$PWD/../Marinara-Agents/tests/long-term-memory-${test}.regression.ts"
done
```

## Exact-artifact lifecycle regression

`hierarchical-maps-lifecycle.regression.ts` installs an immutable prior Maps
artifact through an isolated catalog, updates to the exact current artifact,
then proves reviewed existing-campaign Game map reconciliation, offline restart,
uninstall, reinstall, full-backup creation, and full-backup restore without
deleting the stored definition or spatial snapshot.

Run it with the Engine server toolchain so the package is exercised against the
real host runtime:

```bash
cd ../Marinara-Engine
pnpm --filter @marinara-engine/server exec tsx ../Marinara-Agents/tests/hierarchical-maps-lifecycle.regression.ts
```
