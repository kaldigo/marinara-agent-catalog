# Changelog

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-02 [highlight]

- Fixed "Invalid or missing X-Admin-Secret header" when Marinara is opened from another device (LAN, phone, or proxy). The panel now sends the admin secret saved on that device and explains where to save it.
- Update from History falls back to the default agent connection, then the chat's, when no tracker connection is chosen.
- Automatic runs keep valid changes when the model omits an empty list or returns one malformed persona entry.
- Switching persona or removing a card mid-run no longer reports a failed run.
- Tapping a line label or finishing an automatic update no longer wipes unsaved editor text or closes open sections.
- The persona no longer covers a lone character or sits under relationship lines, and its arrowheads show.
- The lock checkbox stays beside its label at Compact width; status colours are readable in the light theme.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-01

- The description now says what it does in plain words.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-26

- First staging release, with Professor Mari and Crimson Orc sharing pasta as its catalogue cover. Tracks character-card relationships and each character's one-way perception of the active persona in Roleplay group chats, drawn as a fixed-circle relationship web in the Tracker Panel.
- Conservative automatic tracking after each completed reply, a bounded Update from History (1-100 messages), manual editing, optional per-line locks, and Resume Automatic.
- Two prompt-injection modes: All relationships, or Scene-only relationships. Presence lookback (default 15 messages) decides Scene-only eligibility; the automatic tracker's Context Size (default 5) is separate.
- Touch and pen: press a relationship line to reveal its label and press elsewhere to dismiss it; desktop keeps hover and keyboard-focus labels.
- Read-only API for other packages: GET /api/relationship-tracker/v1/chats/:chatId/relationships.
