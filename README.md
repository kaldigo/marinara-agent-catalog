# Marinara Agents

Official downloadable agents and capability packages for [Marinara Engine](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine).

Marinara Engine starts lightweight: a fresh installation contains no optional agents. Open **Agents → Download Agents** on desktop or mobile to browse this catalog, read what each package does, and install only the features you want. Installed packages appear in the normal Agents panel and the chat modes they support. You can update or uninstall them from the same catalog. Restart Marinara Engine when the installer asks you to do so.

Across its Engine compatibility lanes, the stable catalog currently contains **39 first-party packages**: 6 Writer Agents, 13 Tracker Agents, and 20 Misc Agents. Staging-only previews below are additional and are not included in these stable counts. Most packages support **Marinara Engine v2.3.0+**; World Maps and Storyboard require **v2.4.2**; Inventory Tracker and Haptic Feedback require **v2.4.3**; Beholder, Noodle, Memory Nag, Gacha Forge, and Relationship Tracker require **v2.4.4**; Long-Term Memory requires **v2.4.1**; and Slurp and Quartermaster require **v2.4.6**. Every package accepts compatible Engine v2 and v3 releases below **v4.0.0**. Each Engine release sees only the packages compatible with its major version. Users upgrading from an older Engine keep every feature that was available before the package split. Migration downloads matching packages once and preserves existing chat selections, agent settings, runtime data, and history.

## Official catalog

### Writer Agents

| Agent | Package | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Card Evolution Auditor | [`card-evolution-auditor`](packages/card-evolution-auditor/manifest.json) | Suggests character card updates when the story changes a character, for you to approve. |

| Beholder | [`beholder`](packages/beholder/manifest.json) | Keeps track of what each character is wearing and holding, plus any injuries, so the story stays consistent.

| Quest Tracker | [`quest`](packages/quest/manifest.json) | Keeps track of your quests, their goals, and their rewards. |
| Quartermaster | [`quartermaster`](packages/quartermaster/manifest.json) | An RPG character sheet and inventory for Roleplay: equip gear around your persona's portrait, save outfits, get AI art for items, and let it keep everything in step with the story. |

| Haptic Feedback | [`haptic`](packages/haptic/manifest.json) | Controls connected intimate toys to match what happens in the story. Needs Intiface Central running on your computer, with your toy connected there first. |

For complete mode, lifecycle, and settings documentation for every package, see the Engine's [Downloadable Agents Reference](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/blob/staging/docs/agents/built-in-agents.md).

For manual-only Illustrator on the updated Engine staging build, set **Run Interval** to **0** in its setup or when adding it to a chat. This stops automatic Illustrator runs, including automatic scene backgrounds, while keeping the **Gallery → Illustrate** and **Background** actions available. The default remains **5**; choose a positive interval to resume automatic runs. This is an Engine scheduling option, so no Illustrator package update is required.

Slurp offers **Image context for reactions** in settings for fan reactions and creator replies: **Auto** prefers the stored image prompt and falls back to vision, **Stored image prompt only** uses that prompt only, and **Vision** describes the image. Public fans do not receive locked images. Manual creator refresh shows how many requests remain.

### In development

These packages are being built in this repository but are not ready for the stable catalog yet. A package is either **in development** (hidden from every Engine channel) or **staging only** (offered to Engine `staging` testers, hidden from stable `main` users). See [Contributing § Packages that are not ready for everyone](CONTRIBUTING.md#packages-that-are-not-ready-for-everyone).

| Package | ID | Availability | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modern Life Sim | [`modern-life-sim`](packages/modern-life-sim/manifest.json) | Staging only | A modern life sim in its own Home tab: a town on a clock, a job, rent and needs, and a cast drawn from your character cards whose relationships grow scene by scene, with a visual-novel narrator for the scenes that matter. Alpha; offered to Engine `staging` testers from **Home → Life Sim**. |
| Pixelforge | [`pixelforge`](packages/pixelforge/manifest.json) | In development | A pixel-art RPG world for Game Mode that you walk around in. Pick a setting, like a cozy village or a sci-fi colony, then explore, talk to NPCs, and let the Game Master narrate. Under active development; not yet listed for users. |
| 5e (SRD 5.1) | [`ruleset-5e-2014`](packages/ruleset-5e-2014/manifest.json) | Staging only | Play Game Mode by the 5e rules (SRD 5.1): ability checks, saving throws, a full character sheet with spells and class features, and 5e combat against 319 monsters, on a battle board or without positions. Ships only data, no Agent and no code. Needs an Engine with Capability API 1.46, which today means the Engine `staging` branch. |

### Localization sources

Every downloadable package keeps its canonical user-visible metadata in `packages/<id>/locales/en.json`. These catalogs cover package and Agent names and descriptions plus selectable named prompt options, while deliberately excluding model instructions. Translators can add partial BCP 47 catalogs such as `ko.json`; untranslated fields fall back to English once Engine-side catalog localization support consumes them. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#localizing-package-metadata) for the format and validation workflow.

Package-owned interfaces maintain their UI catalogs separately. The metadata catalogs prepared here do not change the Engine's catalog schema or runtime behavior on their own.

## Package trust and storage

The Engine downloads only entries from its Engine-major lane in this official HTTPS catalog, validates the catalog schema, checks Engine version compatibility, verifies the archive SHA-256 checksum, rejects unsafe archive paths and undeclared files, validates each declared file hash and size, and installs atomically into the Engine data directory. Installed packages remain available offline. Server-capability packages run with their declared permissions and require a restart when their runtime changes.

Package source and reproducible build scripts live in this repository instead of the base Engine distribution. Generated artifacts are published under [`artifacts/`](artifacts/), package manifests under [`packages/`](packages/), and machine-readable catalogs under [`catalog/`](catalog/). Engine 2 uses [`catalog/v2/catalog.json`](catalog/v2/catalog.json), Engine 3 uses [`catalog/v3/catalog.json`](catalog/v3/catalog.json), and [`catalog/catalog.json`](catalog/catalog.json) remains the legacy Engine 2 alias.

Catalog entries classify packages as `writer`, `tracker`, or `misc`. Every official package has a square Professor Mari cover under [`artwork/agent-covers/`](artwork/agent-covers/), published through its HTTPS `iconUrl`; Marinara displays that artwork in Download Agents and falls back to the Agents star icon when artwork is unavailable. Agent code does not need to be repackaged when catalog artwork changes.

Conversation mode's About Me profile and `update_about_me` tool are built into Marinara Engine. They are not agents and must not be published in this catalog.

## Contributing

Agent ideas, bugs, documentation corrections, and package improvements are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting: contributions begin with an issue and target the `staging` branch. Engine staging users automatically consume Agents staging for package testing. Every ready PR must pass validation and CodeRabbit; outside and first-time contributors also need an approving review from `SpicyMarinara`. Only `SpicyMarinara` promotes tested staging work to `main`.

## Maintainer build

Build the shared package snapshot and all feature bundles from a neighboring Marinara Engine checkout:

```bash
node scripts/build-agent-catalog.mjs
node scripts/build-feature-packages.mjs
node scripts/build-ruleset-packages.mjs
node scripts/test-catalog-lanes.mjs
node scripts/validate-package-locales.mjs
node scripts/validate-catalog.mjs
```

The build records generic Engine source dependencies needed by feature packages under `sources/engine`. Package-owned implementations stay with their package; for example, World Maps, Long-Term Memory, and Noodle source live under their respective `packages/<id>/src/engine/` trees and are overlaid on those generic dependencies during each build. Noodle also compiles and embeds the same Engine design utilities used by its former built-in interface, preventing visual drift when it runs as a downloaded Home tab.
