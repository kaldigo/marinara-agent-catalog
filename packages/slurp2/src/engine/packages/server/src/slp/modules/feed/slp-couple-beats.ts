/**
 * What a couple's story means for a Creator's next post: a beat, like a collab or a rivalry.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic. The beat says what happens (a date, the hard launch, a fight, the
 * breakup); the flavour brief makes the Creator tell it their own way in the same post call. Big
 * news (launch, anniversary, breakup, reunion, a shared page opening or closing) takes the next
 * ordinary slot; small moments only now and then, and each Creator posts a moment once.
 *
 * A couple is LIFE, a collab is WORK (U, user): a couple post is the Creator's own post with the
 * partner in it as a cameo (date night, their hoodie), no collab tag, no split, not on the partner's
 * page. Only their optional shared page is theirs together.
