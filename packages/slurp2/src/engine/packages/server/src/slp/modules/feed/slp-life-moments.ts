/**
 * Life moments: the day-to-day things that happen to a Creator between the big stories. A workout,
 * a bad day at work, something new to wear, a quiet week, a follower milestone, a post that took
 * off, a fan's tip, a heated comment section.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the beats planner it feeds. See `slp-post-beat.ts`.
 *
 * ## The rules (from the player)
 *
 * - **Same people.** A moment is only used when it fits this Creator: a gym session needs a Creator
 *   whose card or life has sport in it, a work moment needs their work, drama needs a personality
 *   that would start or answer it. A card sentence that says they never or hate doing it rules it
 *   out. A moment that does not fit is dropped, never softened to fit.
 * - **Realism over drama.** Ordinary days are most of life. Drama is rare and only for Creators
 *   who are like that. Milestones, viral posts, gifts and comment fights only happen when the data
 *   says so: nobody celebrates a thousand followers they do not have.
 * - **No sameness.** A moment is not repeated within a Creator's recent posts, one moment reaches at
 *   most two Creators a day, and the kind of moment changes from one to the next.
 *
 * Two sources: moments written around the Creator's own anchors (their work, habits, places and
 * people, read from their card) and a shared pool. Both are only a "what happens"; the flavour
 * brief makes each Creator tell it their own way, in the same post call (no extra AI call).
