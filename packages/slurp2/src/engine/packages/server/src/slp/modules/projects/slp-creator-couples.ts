/**
 * Couples: two Creators with their own pages who get together, and sometimes apart.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the collab and rivalry rules beside it. Nothing here calls a model:
 * who fits whom, how a couple moves from flirting to official to a fight or a breakup, and the
 * moments worth a post are decided by code on the world clock. What a moment means for a post is a
 * beat that rides the Creator's ordinary post call (`slp-tie-beats.ts`).
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * - **Only where both cards allow it (for the world).** A Creator whose card already has a partner is taken (unless
 *   that partner is the other Creator: then the cards made them a couple). A card that never dates,
 *   is aromantic or asexual, or whose stated orientation does not match the other one's gender is
 *   never paired by the world. The world only starts a couple with some chemistry (a shared niche,
 *   a romantic card); the player can set anyone up who is free, and chemistry decides whether it
 *   sticks. Against a card (slice I) it sticks anyway, and the card colors it (`slp-couple-words.ts`).
 * - **Realistic pace.** Sparks (flirting) → dating → together, with dates, anniversaries, jealousy,
 *   fights, making up, breakups and now and then getting back together. Seeded per couple, so the
 *   same world moves the same way.
 * - **One post per moment each.** A moment is news for a few days; each Creator posts it once, and
 *   the small ones only now and then. A couple is life, not work (U): each posts their own side, the
 *   partner shows up as a cameo, nothing is tagged or split; only their shared page is joint.
 * - **Crushes and exes (U).** Sparks is a crush; after a breakup each ex posts about moving on once,
 *   and the ex stays in their briefs and chats for a while (`slp-couple-lines.ts`).
 * - **A shared page** (opt-in from Studio) gets its own posts from both, and closes on a breakup
 *   with a goodbye post.
