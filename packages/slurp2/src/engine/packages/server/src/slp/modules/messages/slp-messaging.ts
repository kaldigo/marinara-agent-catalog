 * The player's accept route draws and schedules its own delivery; a quote an AI fan accepted on the
 * world tick, or an accept whose scheduling failed, was left `accepted` with no delivery time and
 * sat paid and silent forever. These get a delivery time from the same pacing, counted from the
 * accept, so an old one is due at once. A fresh accept is left alone for ten minutes, because the
 * accept route may still be drawing it. Hand-run Creators deliver by hand and are never listed.
